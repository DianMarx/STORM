\subsubsection{Human Access Channels}
The system will be accessible by human users through the following channels:\par
\begin{itemize}
\item From a web browser through a rich web interface. The system must be accessible from any of the standards-compliant web browsers including all recent versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
\item From mobile devices if time allows it.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{System Access Channels}
\begin{itemize}
\item Other systems should be able to access services offered by STORM. Perhaps direct feed of teams into other systems.
\item STORM will have access to a NoSQL database to save and retrieve all information needed to shuffle teams. It will also allow for importing to the database from at least .csv files, and possibly other types.
\end{itemize}
