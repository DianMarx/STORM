The quality requirements are the requirements around the quality attributes of the systems and
the services it provides. Quality requirements relevant to project STORM are listed below in order of priority. \par

\subsubsection{Usability}
Usability is one of the most important quality attributes. Usability tests should be performed to check whether:
\begin{itemize}
\item whether users find any aspects of the system cumbersome, non-intuitive or frustrating.
\item whether the user has a positive experience and finds the functionality easy to use and learn.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Scalability}
The system must implement a very generic optimization algorithm in order to be used by different parties in different contexts. In addition to different environments the system should be able to optimize groups for an extremely large number of subjects.

\subsubsection{Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The optimization algorithm should be able to sort a maximum of 10 000 subjects into groups and respond within 5 seconds.
\item Reporting queries should respond within 15 seconds. \par
The above figures does not include network round trip which is outside the control of the system.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Maintainability} 
\subsubsection{Reliability}
\subsubsection{Deployability}
\subsubsection{Security}
\subsubsection{Testability}
