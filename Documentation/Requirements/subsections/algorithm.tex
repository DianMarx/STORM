\subsubsection{Use-cases}

The algorithm module adds the functionality required to shuffle subjects into teams.\par

\begin{enumerate}
\item RandomShuffle\par
Priority: Critical.\par
Pre-condition: Project must have users.\par
Pre-condition: Team size or number of teams must be specified.\par
Post-condition: Random teams are built.\par

\item SimilarShuffle\par
Priority: Critical.\par
Pre-condition: Project must have users.\par
Pre-condition: Team size or number of teams must be specified.\par
Pre-condition: Criteria with weights should be selected.\par
Pre-condition: Similar shuffle should be specified.\par
Post-condition: Similar teams are built.\par

\item DiverseShuffle\par
Priority: Critical.\par
Pre-condition: Project must have users.\par
Pre-condition: Team size or number of teams must be specified.\par
Pre-condition: Criteria with weights should be selected.\par
Pre-condition: Diverse shuffle should be specified.\par
Post-condition: Diverse teams are built.\par
