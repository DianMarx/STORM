The STORM system enables users to build teams, from a list of subjects, by selecting a set of criteria. This will aid the users in such a way that the users do not have to build the teams manually, which may require a lot of time. The users can spend their time rather on analysing the results of each "Rocking the Boat" round to change the criteria for the next round more effectively.
