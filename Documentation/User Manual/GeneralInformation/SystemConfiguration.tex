The back-end of this system should be hosted on a server, as it is a relatively small system, and open source. It can be hosted on a fairly inexpensive server which runs on Linux.

Keep in mind that as the database grows, a bigger server will need to be integrated.  This will be effortless as the system is designed to be scalable.


\subsubsection{Front-end}
	Refer to this section for information on the front-end part of the system. For example the part that will be used by the bulk of the users to shuffle the teams on the web client.\par

For users to use the system, they only need a web activated device with a web browser. The user will be abe to import subjects for their projects by uploading a .csv file that will be added to the database. The user will also be able to download the results of their team by downloading a .csv file from the database.

The STORM system works best with Google Chrome, but can be used on all other browsers.
