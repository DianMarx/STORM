the standards-compliant web browsers including all recent versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
\item 2. From mobile devices if time allows it.
\end{itemize}

STORM will have access to a NoSQL database to save and retrieve all information needed to shuffle teams. It will also allow for importing to the database from at least CSV files, and possibly other types.
